# shed
Switch between multiple GitHub accounts without dealing with SSH keys

- This tool is strictly global and does not alter the GitHub user settings
  within Code Editors/IDEs such as Visual Studio or JetBrains products.

- I used a Zsh script because it is my preferred choice,
  but you can modify the script to use Bash, POSIX, or
  any other shell of your choice.
